# Dotfiles
Under heavy contruction (i.e. a big mess) until the perfect key setup is settled

## Workflow
The object of my configuration is to achieve the most functionality possible with the least amount of finger movement, while maintaining a logical layout, partially resembling the ergonomics of a video controller, insofar as it uses the outermost edges (i.e. the shoulder buttons) for certain auxilary functions, and metonymic as far as keyboard shortcuts and remaps for punctuation are concerned.
