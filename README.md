Under heavy contruction (i.e. a big mess) until the perfect key setup is settled

## Workflow
The object of my configuration is to achieve the most functionality possible with 
the least amount of finger movement, while maintaining a logical layout, partially 
resembling the ergonomics of a video controller, insofar as it uses the outermost 
edges (i.e. the shoulder buttons) for modifying functions central to the workflow. 
Punctuation keys are remapped to metonymic layer, while shortcut binds should be
organized in the manner of spacemacs, as the most memorable and extensive method.
